First, run your emulator and then run the code. The page in front of you will be the home page.

Click on the 'Daily Sign Languages' button. The page that opens in front of you currently contains 3 videos of sign languages
that you can use in daily life. Click on any of them and play the video our friend shot in the window that opens.
